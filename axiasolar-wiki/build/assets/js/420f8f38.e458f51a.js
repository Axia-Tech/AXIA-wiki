It should be straightforward to see how we can translate\nthis to the allychain terms. The state transition function for a roll-up-like allychain would be\nupdating the state (in practice, most likely a Merkle tree, which would be easily verifiable) from\nthe user inputs. The operator would act as the collator node, which would aggregate the state and\ncreate the zk-SNARK proof that it would hand to a relay chain's validators for verification."),(0,l.kt)("p",null,"If you or your team are interested in developing a PDK feel free to open an issue on the\n",(0,l.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://github.com/axia-tech/Web3-collaboration"},"W3F collaboration repository")," for comment.\nThere may be grants available for this type of work."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0},75759:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/AXIAjs_network_allychains-37c2c68745caeb93d6b178c0e6e388b3.png"},56239:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/betanet-downward-transfer-2e9fa0c36591e79f42c04583dd9d777e.png"},56138:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/betanet-lateral-transfer-10eba5a56a3f34f561576e33c9eef708.png"},68407:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/betanet-lateral-transfer2-6dc12e8bf0cbcf74bd8d0a02e61159a7.png"},10057:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/betanet-upward-transfer-f21f9a2e1431b838823566a529009427.png"}}]);
