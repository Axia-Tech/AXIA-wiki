It's time to get started on the AXIALunar network! Please check out our recommended list for getting started.

For brand-new learners of Blockchain technology:

- The [Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC course][mooc] is a great introduction to familiarizing yourself with crytography, blockchain concepts, decentralization, networks, cryptocurrency, and so much more. This is recommended for users with backgrounds of all levels, and is also a free course.

For brand-new learners of AXIALunar:

- [Reading the AXIALunar Overview page][overview]
- [Reading the "What is AXIALunar"][medium] article on Medium.
- [Creating a AXIALunar Account][create-account]
- [Using AXIALunar endpoints][endpoints]
- [Claiming AXIALunar LUNAR tokens][tokens]
- [Running a Validator on AXIALunar][validator]
- [Staking as a Nominator on AXIALunar][nominator]

For brand-new learners of AXIALunar's cousin network, AXIASolar, please head over to our [AXIASolar Wiki][axiasolar wiki].

While AXIALunar does not support smart contracts natively, building apps on it is still possible (example: [RMRK.app](https://rmrk.app)). If you're interested in diving deeper into _proper_ development however, the [builders guide from AXIASolar's wiki][axiasolar-builders] applies to AXIALunar as well.
