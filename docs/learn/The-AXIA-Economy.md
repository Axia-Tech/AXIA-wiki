## AXIA Tokenomics

AXIA is introducing a proprietary monetary model that combines a number of economic features that provide unique benefits to participants and holders of the AXIA Coin. 

AXIA is the first ever hyper-deflationary network with an asset-supported digital currency that provides real-time transparency of its treasury holdings and all network activity. 

All the value generated from the applications, platforms and businesses on the AXIA Network and within the AXIA Ecosystem have been architected to ensure that any proceeds coming from these structures is transferred into the AXIA Treasury. 

With AXIA being a non-profit, the network and ecosystem function as a distributed and decentralized stakeholder model. The holders of AXIA Coin have a true stake in not only the value that comes from all the extensive utility offered with AXIA Coin but have a share in each of the applications, platforms and businesses along with the network itself. So, if an individual holds AXIA Coin then the enterprise value is their own, not belonging to a for-profit centralized organization or company. This economic system offers a higher level of decentralization, it removes barriers to entry and can generate more productivity and prosperity for all who participate and hold AXIA Coin. 

With AXIA everyone has a stake in a whole AXIA economy. An economy that is decentralized and will only continue to expand, increasing the benefits for the AXIA community over time. 

The innovative tokenomics for the network are on full display to the public as there is visibility of the constant decrease in Total Supply of AXIA Coin which makes it more and more scarce over time, while simultaneously there is the ability to view how the AXIA Treasury can be increasing at the same time. The AXIA Treasury has been established to give additional support to AXIA Coin and its holders. 

The unique combination of a coin supply that reduces through coin burning from activities such as participating, staking and other activities, along with a treasury that can grow with total visibility to the market provides the means for the enhancement of the purchasing power of AXIA Coin over time. This proprietary tokenomic design is enabled by a variety of smart contracts built into the AXIA Network.

Wherever possible, third-parties have been utilized to review, report and audit on the viability of the economics, the reporting tools utilized and smart contracts put in place to ensure security, transparency, reliability and credibility is always in place.  

AXIA is delivering fundamental value to the market through its innovative monetary policy and economic design. Not only do the participants have a stake in all the assets, including the network itself, and all the value they produce, but that value is distributed amongst all the participants who created  it. This design is far more decentralized than other organizations that have a dependency on smaller groups of individuals, and in which the rewards only go to a select few. AXIA can truly decentralize our economy for the benefit of everyone.
