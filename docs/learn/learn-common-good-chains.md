Moonbeam based bridge support delivers complete Ethereum compatibility with the AXIA Network AllyChain environment, so projects and developers can continue to use the programming languages and tools they have become accustomed to â€” but within a fast-growing, scalable Layer 1 chain with far superior economics. Moonbeam is an open source project with a vision of multi chains in mind. Hence, is a strong fit to the AXIA network ecosystem as it provides cross chain smart contract capabilities. The design of the project was made to fit the needs of the users and assets existing across multiple Blockchains. It is also compatible with the Substrate and the entire AXIA ecosystem, block explorers, wallets, AllyChain etc. This provides greater flexibility, convenience and simplicity regardless of the tools that are chosen. It will also allow developers of projects to deploy Smart Contracts to the AXIA network as an AllyChain knowing there is the ability towill support Ethereum compatible smart contracts. Since these bridges offer an interoperability layer with existing Ethereum based tools , it will support all applications that were originally written for the EVM environment without friction on the AXIA network.
