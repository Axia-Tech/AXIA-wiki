The AXIA Ambassador Programme is an initiative ran by the AXIA Foundation to support potential
contributors to the AXIA community and ecosystem.

## How it works

If you are enthusiastic about AXIA and Web3 and are willing to help the community grow, you can
join the program and receive funding for hosting events, gain access to communication channels of
core team members, and gain access to AXIA events.

There are many ways you can get involved in expanding AXIAâ€™s ecosystem, such as:

- Contributing code and documentation related to the ecosystem
- Speaking about AXIA at events, workshops, and meetups
- Writing blog posts
- Representing AXIA in your region
- Mentoring and onboarding newcomers
- Identifying partnerships and opportunities for the AXIA ecosystem
- Participating in calls and tasks that help drive the ecosystem forward
