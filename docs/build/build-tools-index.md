### SCALE Codec

The [SCALE](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/codec) (Simple Concatenated
Aggregate Little-Endian) Codec is a lightweight, efficient, binary serialization and deserialization
codec.

It is designed for high-performance, copy-free encoding and decoding of data in resource-constrained
execution contexts, such as the Substrate runtime. It is not self-describing in any way and assumes
the decoding context has all type knowledge about the encoded data.

It is used in almost all communication to/from Substrate nodes, so implementations in different
languages exist:

- [Ruby](https://github.com/itering/scale.rb)
- [Rust](https://github.com/axia-tech/parity-scale-codec)
- [Go](https://github.com/itering/scale.go)
- [C++](https://github.com/soramitsu/kagome/tree/master/core/scale)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/axiasolar-js/api)
- [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/LimeChain/as-scale-codec)
- [Haskell](https://github.com/airalab/hs-web3/tree/master/src/Codec)
- [Java](https://github.com/emeraldpay/polkaj)
- [Python](https://github.com/polkascan/py-scale-codec)
