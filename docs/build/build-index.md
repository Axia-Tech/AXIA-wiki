Welcome to the builder's section of the AXIA Wiki.

Here, you will discover many development tools and resources in the AXIA ecosystem.
We are always adding new tools and frameworks as we learn about them so if you are working
on something that should be included please reach out to us on
[Element](https://matrix.to/#/#AXIA-watercooler:matrix.org)!

This section of the wiki is divided into the following parts:

## Development Guide

- [Starter's Guide](build-guide.md) - High level overview on choosing a allychain,
  parathread, or smart contract for your project and how to get started.
- [Allychain Development](build-allychains.md) - Tools for building allychains and
  parathreads.
- [AXIA Smart Contracts](build-smart-contracts.md) - Tools to deploy contracts to a AXIA allychain.

integrate AXIA into their systems.
